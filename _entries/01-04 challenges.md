Useful resources are provided to help you work through each task. If you're working through this as part of a team based hack, ensure you make progress at a good pace by dividing the workload between team members where possible. This may mean anticipating work that might be required in a later task.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions.

### Core tasks

Running through this as part of a one day workshop, you should be able to complete all of the **Getting up and running** section. This involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the application containers from Docker Hub, creating a private registry, and deploying Aqua CSP.

### DevSecOps tasks

Once you're done with the Core tasks, next would be to include some DevSecOps. **Complete as many tasks as you can**. You'll be setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline for your application in Azure DevOps. You will also scan your images for security issues (both in registries and in CI/CD pipelines), and enforce runtime security policies using Aqua CSP.
