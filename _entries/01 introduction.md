Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes & Aqua Security Workshop. In this lab, you'll go through tasks that will help you master different topics required to deploy a multi-container application to Kubernetes on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), and setup security scans (both in registries and in CI/CD pipelines) and enforce security policies using Aqua Cloud-native Security Platform (CSP). 

You can use this guide as a Kubernetes tutorial and as study material to help you get started to learn Kubernetes.

Some of the things youâ€™ll be going through:

- Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress
- Deploying MongoDB using Helm version 3
- Building CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and Azure Container Registry
- Setting up security scans and enforcing security policies using Aqua CSP
